### NEWS

Fixes:

* `FIXED` Build problem on Linux caused by using the system-provided discount library.

### HELP NEEDED

##### Packages

We really need help packaging CuteMarkEd. Especially for Linux and Mac OS X. For Linux there is already an [openSUSE Build Service project](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:cloose1974/CuteMarkEd), but it's outdated. Please contact me if you like to help.

##### Translations

We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/cutemarked) for the translations. Currently we have translations for Chinese, Czech, German and Greek. We are always interested in more translations.
